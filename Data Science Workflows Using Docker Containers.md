# Data Science Workflows Using Docker Containers

## Abstract

Dta Science requires auditable workflows where we can easily share and reproduce results. Docker is a useful tool that we can use to package libraries, code, and data into a single image. This talk will cover the basics of Docker; discuss how containers fit into Data Science workflows; and provide a quick-start guide that can be used as a template to create a shareable Docker image! Learn how to leverage the power of Docker without having to worry about the underlying details of the technology
